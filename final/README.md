Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I had no prior knowledge of coding at all before entering this class so I did not really know what to expect coming into this
class. At first I was very intimidated as if I were meeting expectations and doing things correctly, but in each module and
lesson was very explanatory and easy to follow which helped a lot. So I pretty much learned a lot as to the different systems we
used and how they intertwine with each other and really what each element did and what function is reserved.

Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?
I would say I learned a lot using styling elements and what different attributes do what. The thing that helped the most was the
how to do links you added that also gave a lot of examples and a plethora of options when it came to using different fonts and colors. You really do not realize how much goes into web pages and all the elements that go together.

Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.
I definitely had quite a few challenges and the biggest help was of course the links and examples you provided. For being a completely online class it was very helpful to reach out and have all questions answered. Of course this was only an introductory level class but each lesson plan, overview video and module gave clear and explanatory descriptions to refer back too.
