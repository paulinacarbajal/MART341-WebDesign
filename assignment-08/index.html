      <h4>Lyrics</h4>
    <div id="lyrics" class="container" class="lyrics"
    <p>Ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne,
      Ooooh, ah
      Ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne,
      Oooooh, ah</p>
    <p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
      I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
      I miss my cocoa butter kisses
      I miss my cocoa butter kisses</p>
    <p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank

    <p>I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
      I miss my cocoa butter kisses
      I miss my cocoa butter kisses</p>

<p>Okie dokie, alky, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie</p>

<p>Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my Lucky
Tonight she just yelling "**** me", two weeks you'll be yelling **** me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie</p>

<p>And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would ****ing hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)</p>

<p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses</p>

<p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses</p>

<p>I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale,
Everywhere that I go, everywhere
They be asking hows it going, say the going's well
Go figure, Victor's light-skinned</p>

<p>Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God, God knows
He's a pro, he's a pro like Cointel, check, check mate, check me
Take me to the bedroom, let you know me well, I mean normally, you see
Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil</p>

<p>But these kids these days, they get so
High, burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel ****, ****-faced
Faced it, 15 hits on this L elevated, train, and the craziest
Thing, got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my **** delegated</p>

<p>Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it,
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, ***hole, absinthe up in that class
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong</p>

<p>We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass
I think we all addicted,
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted</p>

<p>I think we all addicted
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses
I think we all addicted, kisses, kisses, kisses</p>

<p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses (Twista)</p>

<p>I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter
Two seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi</p>

<p>You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie</p>

<p>And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG</p>

<p>Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is</p>

<p>Ima end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praised and I'm thanking</p>

<p>I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, Ugh
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank</p>

<p>I got burn holes in my memories my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted</p>

<p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses, kisses</p>

<p>Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, kisses, kisses, kisses</p>
