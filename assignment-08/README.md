The id is seen to be like a global identifier or also an identification label, this should be a unique identifier to that specific element.
The class attribute groups similar types of elements together and allows for easy styling.
The div element offers developers block-level element that groups together common elements. These can be singular or nested within each other. This creates clarity and increases readability of the code.
Lastly there is the span element that is equivalent to the <div> element, it can reference to styling code or give information about inner content.

Some advantages to using youtube would be having direct access to embed a video and it can provides all the information you need to copyright it. But a disadvantage to a lot fo Vimeo videos is that you do not always have the rights to copy a a video unless permission is granted. Vimeo videos I think are more secured and private while youtube most videos are public. 

I had a hard time doing the copyright section I did not quite understand what was being asked but I referred back to your overview video and I think that showed me how to do the task correctly. I like that we are learning more ways to embed videos and music and how simple it is for the iframe element to provide all the information.
