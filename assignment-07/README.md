A lot of common forms you see on job or school applications are ones about race and gender. They obviously do this for demographic purposes but it is always optional to answer.

Some of the most common examples text, selection and button inputs are used when you are online shopping. Picking sizes consists of selection inputs.
When you submit an order or put in your name, address and payment method uses both text and button inputs.
