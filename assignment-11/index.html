              "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent"
              -Eleanor Roosevelt; activist, feminist, superhero, long-living First Lady of the United States evah

              "One of the most staggering things about other people is that they can provide
              us with valuable, and often alarmingly intimate information about who they are as soon as we meet them.
              If we pay attention, we can pick up on the major clues they're sending out through their body language
              their appearance, their lifestyle, their actions, their interests, their words, how they treat their dogs,
              the waitress, themselves, etc. Some people let it all hang out for everyone to see right away, others let it
              seep out in little spurts: "I love water skiing," I admire how confident you are about your weight problems,
              "I just got out of prison," etc. With the exception of the sociopath or the skilled pathological liar, the
              majority of humanity gives us plenty to chew on right out of the gate."
              </div>
              <div>
                All of this information then goes through the filter of who we are,
                and depending on our preceptions and judgements and hang up s and number of years spend in therapy,
                we decide if the person is someone we wnat to get to know better or not.
              </div>
              <div>
                We're all attracted to, as well as turned off by, various things about other people.
                and the things that stand out the most to us are the things that remind us the most of ourselves.
                This is because other people are like mirrors for us: If somebody bugs you, your're projecting onto them
                something that you don't like about yourself, and if you think they're awesome, they're reflecting back something that you see in
                yourself that you like (even if it's not developed in you yet). I know this sounds like I'm making a massive generalization, but stay with me here.
              </div>
              <div>
                Your reality is created by what you focus on and how you choose to interpret it. This goes for everything,
                including the things you focus on about the people in your world. For example, depending on who you are, you could react in myriad ways to your new boyfriend
                 or girlfriend constantly referring to you as "The Giant Dumb***." You could A.) See this as a red flag and think you're a bully
                 B.) See this as a red flag and think they're nervous or insecure and have terrible manners C.) See this as a green light because "they are in so much pain that they need to abuse other people. They really ned someone as understanding as I am."
                 D.)See this as a green light because you believe that you are, in fact, a giant dumb*** or E.) Think it's hilarious because it doesn't resonate with you.
                </div>
                <div>
                  The people you surround yourself with are excellent mirrors for who you are and how much,
                  or how little, you love yourself.
