Borders help define the amount of space an element or box takes up and in relation to other boxes or elements. The border can be specifically colored and styled unlike margin and padding. Padding is described as the amount of space between inner content of an element and the element itself. We also use padding when styling font and font size so letters are evenly and equally spaced. Now margin is seen as the space between the box or element in relation to the other elements, or the edge outside the border. 

I think this week it was tricky making sure all elements were included and in the correct order. I think the coding itself makes it harder making sure each bracket is closed and all the divs are being used correctly. As always I refer back to your examples to make sure I have all the correct elements in place.
