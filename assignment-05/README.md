1. I chose to view the target website from 10 years ago since I use the site very frequently. Compared to what the site looks like today, the layout has changed slightly and the overall modernized look is slightly adjusted. The site today looks more user friendly, and easier to navigate then it was 10 years ago.

2. I had a hard time seeing changes come up on my github desktop, I think I just need to naviage the desktop app more as it has a much different layout then the website itself. I feel like I am not embedding links and images correctly but would like some feedback to see if it is showing correctly on your end. Overall I am enjoying learning how to do more with the atom and github desktop application.
