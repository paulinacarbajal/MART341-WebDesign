For this weeks assignment I created a photography page for my client Jessica Smith, looking up local photographers I knew of, I kind of used certain elements and color palettes that complimented Jessica's aesthetic. Obviously each photographers uses different color schemes, fonts and layouts to display their work but I chose to use more warm toned colors and easy to read fonts.

It is very important to consider a mobile-design first because most influencers advertise websites through their social media pages. When someone is scrolling through instagram and comes across a page that is promoting a website, you obviously click and it directs you towards the site, having a mobile-first design ensures you see the entirety of someones webpage and all the content that is displayed clearly.

This week obviously just keeps building from last week and I think the challenge of course was making sure we styled each element that was needed. I liked how you included a homework overview video that showed a clear example of how you wanted everything organized and neat. I think when styling each individual element like tables and picture and layout of the page, it can become tedious and you can easily forget a line or a closing bracket with everything jumbled together. Organization was definitely key to accomplishing this assignment.
