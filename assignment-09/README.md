I think after learning all the elements slowly it was easy to begin html and add everything that is needed for the head and body elements. Repetition helped for sure. Styling was definitely a little harder to learn making sure you have all the pieces. I was slightly confused about if it defaults to styling the whole page the same or why you have to go into styling each step individually.

I am honestly just excited to learn more about styling and the different elements that go along with it. It definitely can be overwhelming at first but gets easier as you do it more.

For one, going into this class I did not really know what to expect and I saw that you had mentioned some material being introduced in prior coding classes. Personally I have never been in a coding class so having no prior knowledge, you have done a great job providing examples and introducing each lesson that is flexible and easy to retain. I like all the resources you provide for us that makes it very understandable. I know I asked about setting our code in a preview status so we can see what it actually looks like but I still have not managed to  figure it out. Would love to meet with you possibly to get some more questions answered. Overall referreing to your examples helped a lot on this assignment as it involved putting everything together.
