A browser is a software program used to access the internet from a device. Web designers use web languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript to write the instructions that browsers translate and render for layout of texts, graphics and other content. The most common browser I use is Google Chrome.

Markup language is everything you see on a browser including the text, style and script used. The most common being html (hypertext markup language) also known as the foundation and structure of a pages content.
