What library did you choose?
I chose to use the library Bootstrap. I chose this library because initially it seemed the most basic example to go off of and I did not think there was much to change around at first. It seemed easier to incorporate in a project I was reopening, than the other libraries that seemed to have a lot more elements involved. 

Did you use a local file or CDN? Why?
I chose a local file because I was basing it off a prior project and wanted to added changes that could be seen offline. I thought it was much simpler to create and add and unadd pieces from a local file that I already had than using a CDN file.

How does HTML5 change the web?
HTML5 adds a lot more elements and attributes that kind of simplifies the coding process. I think it also tries to make the coding process easier and keeps things more organized as new behaviors are introduced.

Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them.
I had a couple challenges getting started with using a new canvas. Bootstrap to me at first, seemed easier to pick up and made it easier to add and unadd pieces to a project I had already begun. The example provided helped me navigate my way through my assignment and made the new material not as intimidating.
