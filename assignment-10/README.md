1. Theres multiple ways of selecting elements from an HTML page. The universal selector is used to style every element in the page, while the element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. Class names are used to style elements and is a great way to select elements that serve the same function. The ID selector also helps define specific styles rules for a specific element that uses a unique ID. I would probably use a universal selector when I want a page to be styled all the same. And if I wanted each line to be specifically stylized I would then use class and ID selectors.

2. For this assignment I used very bold and bright colors to go along with the decade I chose. I chose to showcase fashion trends from the 80s and I feel like colors like neon green, pink and baby blue go along with the bold colors people would wear in that decade. I did throw some black in there as there were some edgier styles that I showed. 

3. I think this week did become a little trickier as a lot more styling attributes were added. But in the end it was simpler as it was just little details. I think the repetition of going along the same lines of styling and just building off of it helps with structure.
